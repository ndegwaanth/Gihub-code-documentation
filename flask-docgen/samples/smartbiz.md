# Overview

[![Jaseci Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndegwaanth/jaseci/main/docs/images/jaseci_logo.png)](https://www.jaseci.org/)

Jaseci is an open-source framework for building scalable AI applications with graph-based computing. This repository appears to be a fork or mirror of the main [Jaseci project](https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci).

> **Note**: This documentation is generated based on the repository structure and available files. For official documentation, please refer to the [Jaseci Docs](https://docs.jaseci.org/).

# Architecture

```

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| JAC Language | Domain-specific language for AI workflows |
| Graph Engine | Manages graph-based computation |
| AI Modules | Pre-built AI capabilities (NLP, CV, etc.) |
| Orchestration | Distributed execution and scaling |
| APIs | REST and GraphQL interfaces |

# Key Modules

## 1. JAC Language

Jaseci's proprietary language for defining AI workflows:

```python
# Example JAC code
walker init {
    root = spawn here --> graph::example;
    take --> node::root;
    report root;
}
```

<details>
<summary>JAC Language Features</summary>

- Graph traversal semantics
- Built-in AI operations
- Parallel execution constructs
- Type system for AI components

</details>

## 2. Core Engine

The main execution environment:

```python
from jaseci.jsorc.jsorc import JsOrc

# Initialize the engine
js = JsOrc()
js.save_glob("config", {"option": "value"})
```

## 3. AI Modules

Pre-built AI capabilities:

```python
from jaseci.actions.live_actions import load_module_actions

# Load NLP module
load_module_actions("jac_nlp")
```

# How It Works

1. **Define Workflows**: Create JAC programs describing AI pipelines
2. **Execute**: Runtime processes the graph-based workflows
3. **Scale**: Distributed execution across nodes
4. **Integrate**: Connect with external systems via APIs
