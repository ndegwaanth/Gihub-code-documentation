# JacLang Documentation

## Overview

JacLang is a powerful programming language designed for graph-based workflows, artificial intelligence, and data-intensive applications. It provides a rich set of features for manipulating graphs, executing walkers (akin to functions), and interacting with nodes and edges. JacLang is particularly well-suited for applications in healthcare, insurance, and other domains that require complex data relationships.

This repository contains the core implementation of JacLang, including its lexer, parser, interpreter, and a suite of tools for testing, debugging, and deploying JacLang applications. The codebase is structured to support extensibility, allowing developers to add new features or customize existing ones.

## Key Features

- **Graph-Based Workflows**: JacLang is centered around graphs, allowing users to define nodes, edges, and walkers (functions that traverse the graph). This makes it ideal for modeling complex relationships and workflows.
  
- **Interpreter and Debugger**: The language comes with a built-in interpreter and debugger, enabling developers to execute and troubleshoot their JacLang programs efficiently.

- **CLI Tools**: JacLang includes a command-line interface (CLI) for running, formatting, and debugging JacLang scripts. This makes it easy to integrate JacLang into development workflows.

- **Extensibility**: The language is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add custom functionality through plugins or by modifying the core implementation.

- **Security Features**: JacLang includes middleware for adding security headers, ensuring that applications built with JacLang are secure by default.

- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: JacLang supports LSP, enabling integration with popular IDEs like VSCode for features such as code completion, error checking, and navigation.

## Architecture

The JacLang repository is organized into several key components:

1. **Lexer and Parser**: The `JacLexer` and `JacParser` classes handle tokenization and parsing of JacLang source code, converting it into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

2. **Interpreter**: The interpreter executes the AST, running the JacLang program. It includes features like breakpoints, stepping through code, and handling exceptions.

3. **Debugger**: The debugger provides tools for inspecting the state of a running program, setting breakpoints, and stepping through code.

4. **CLI**: The `JacCmd` class implements the command-line interface, allowing users to run JacLang scripts, format code, and debug programs.

5. **Middleware**: Classes like `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` add security features to JacLang applications.

6. **LSP Support**: JacLang includes a language server that provides IDE features such as code completion, error checking, and navigation.

## Core Components

### Lexer (`JacLexer`)

The `JacLexer` class is responsible for tokenizing JacLang source code. It converts the source code into a series of tokens that can be parsed by the `JacParser`.

### Parser (`JacParser`)

The `JacParser` class takes the tokens produced by the lexer and constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST represents the structure of the program and is used by the interpreter to execute the code.

### Interpreter

The interpreter executes the AST, running the JacLang program. It handles control flow, variable assignments, and function calls. The interpreter also supports debugging features such as breakpoints and stepping through code.

### Debugger (`DebuggerTerminated`)

The debugger allows developers to inspect the state of a running program, set breakpoints, and step through code. The `DebuggerTerminated` exception is raised when the debugger terminates cleanly.

### CLI (`JacCmd`)

The `JacCmd` class implements the command-line interface for JacLang. It includes commands for running, formatting, and debugging JacLang scripts.

### Middleware (`SecurityHeadersMiddleware`)

The `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` class adds security headers to JacLang applications, ensuring that they are secure by default.

### Language Server Protocol (LSP)

JacLang supports LSP, enabling integration with popular IDEs like VSCode. The LSP provides features such as code completion, error checking, and navigation.

## Usage

### Running a JacLang Script

To run a JacLang script, use the `jac run` command:

```bash
jac run my_script.jac
```

### Formatting Code

JacLang includes a code formatting tool that can be invoked with the `jac format` command:

```bash
jac format my_script.jac
```

### Debugging a Script

To debug a JacLang script, use the `jac debug` command:

```bash
jac debug my_script.jac
```

### Viewing Help

For a list of available commands, use the `jac --help` command:

```bash
jac --help
```

## Project Significance

JacLang is designed to simplify the development of graph-based applications, particularly in domains where complex data relationships are common. By providing a rich set of tools for manipulating graphs and executing workflows, JacLang enables developers to build robust and scalable applications with ease.

The language's extensibility and integration with modern development tools (e.g., IDEs via LSP) make it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications. Whether you're building a healthcare system, an insurance platform, or a data-intensive AI application, JacLang provides the tools you need to succeed.

## Conclusion

JacLang is a powerful and versatile programming language designed for graph-based workflows and data-intensive applications. With its rich set of features, extensibility, and integration with modern development tools, JacLang is an excellent choice for developers looking to build robust and scalable applications.
