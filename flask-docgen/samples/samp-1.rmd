# Overview

This repository hosts a robust and scalable data cleaning and analysis pipeline designed to preprocess, visualize, and analyze datasets efficiently. The project is built using R and Python, leveraging key libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. 

The primary goal of this pipeline is to streamline the data preparation process, ensuring that datasets are clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or model training. It includes functionalities for handling missing values, removing duplicates and outliers, standardizing data types, and scaling numerical data. Additionally, it provides tools for generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and automated machine learning models.

# Architecture

The project is structured into modular functions, each addressing a specific aspect of data processing or analysis. The key components include:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Functions to clean and preprocess datasets, ensuring they are ready for analysis.
2. **Data Visualization**: Tools to generate insightful visualizations for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Functions to compute and summarize dataset statistics.
4. **Machine Learning Integration**: Features to train initial models, such as ARIMA for time series or churn prediction models.
5. **Security and Optimization**: Functions to handle user authentication, CSRF tokens, and optimize performance through vectorized operations and caching.

# Core Components

## 1. Data Cleaning

### `data_cleaning`
Performs all essential data cleaning steps on the DataFrame, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and scaling numerical data.

### `handle_missing_values`
Handles missing values in the DataFrame by filling numerical columns with the mean and categorical columns with the mode.

### `remove_duplicates`
Removes duplicate rows from the DataFrame.

### `remove_outliers`
Removes outliers from numerical columns using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

### `standardize_data_types`
Standardizes data types in the DataFrame, converting date columns to datetime and object columns to category.

### `scale_numeric_data`
Scales numerical data using MinMaxScaler to ensure all features are on a similar scale.

## 2. Data Visualization

### `create_visualization`
Generates optimized visualizations for exploratory data analysis.

### `plot_categorical_distributions`
Visualizes the distributions of categorical variables.

### `plot_numerical_relationships`
Visualizes relationships between numerical variables.

### `plot_mixed_relationships`
Visualizes relationships between numerical and categorical variables.

## 3. Descriptive Statistics

### `generate_descriptive_stats`
Generates descriptive and inferential statistics for any dataset, returning structured results in a dictionary.

## 4. Machine Learning Integration

### `train_initial_model`
Trains a model from scratch and returns performance metrics.

### `prepare_time_series`
Prepares datasets for time series analysis.

### `predict_churn`
Predicts churn for new data provided in JSON format.

## 5. Security and Optimization

### `load_data`
Optimizes data loading with caching to improve performance.

### `create_filter_mask`
Performs vectorized filtering for better performance.

### `ensure_csrf_token` & `inject_csrf_token`
Ensure the correct handling of CSRF tokens for secure web applications.

# Usage

To use this pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Load Data**: Use the `load_data` function to import your dataset into the environment.
2. **Clean Data**: Apply the `data_cleaning` function to preprocess the data. This function internally calls `handle_missing_values`, `remove_duplicates`, `remove_outliers`, `standardize_data_types`, and `scale_numeric_data`.
3. **Analyze Data**: Use the `generate_descriptive_stats` function to compute summary statistics and the visualization functions (`plot_categorical_distributions`, `plot_numerical_relationships`, `plot_mixed_relationships`) to explore the data.
4. **Train Models**: Utilize the `train_initial_model` or `predict_churn` functions to build and evaluate machine learning models.
5. **Secure Applications**: Implement the `ensure_csrf_token` and `inject_csrf_token` functions if deploying the pipeline in a web environment.

# Project Significance

This project is significant for several reasons:

1. **Automation**: The pipeline automates repetitive data cleaning and preprocessing tasks, saving time for data scientists and analysts.
2. **Scalability**: The use of vectorized operations and caching ensures the pipeline can handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Flexibility**: Modular design allows users to customize the pipeline to suit their specific needs.
4. **Insightful Visualizations**: Built-in visualization tools help users quickly understand data distributions and relationships.
5. **Security**: The inclusion of CSRF token handling ensures secure integration with web applications.
